# Python-Scripts
Starting from the basics of Python Programming and proceeding towards the advance level

Hi,
Python is a great language, you can do almost anything with it.The IDE for Python is Python Shell and the version I am using is Version3.4
but the lastest version is also present at their official website. You can easily download it from there.

Thanks.
